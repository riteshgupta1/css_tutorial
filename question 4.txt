Questin : 
How are inline and block elements different from each other?

Solution : 1. Block Elements (display: block;)

    Always start on a new line.
    Take up the full width available (by default).
    Can contain inline and other block elements.
    Can have width, height, margins, and padding.
Block elements, on the other hand, are those that start on a new line and take up the full width available. They are typically used for structural elements, such as:
- div
- p (paragraphs)
- h1-h6 (headings)
- ul (unordered lists)
- ol (ordered lists)

        Example.
    <div>This is a block element</div>
<p>This is a paragraph</p>
<h1>Heading 1</h1>


Inline Elements (display: inline;)

    Do not start on a new line.
    Only take up as much width as necessary.
    Can only contain text or other inline elements.
    Cannot have width and height properties.

     Inline Elements: Inline elements are those that do not start on a new line and only take up the space needed to display their content. They are typically used for text-level elements, such as:
- span
- a (hyperlinks)
- img (images)
- input (form inputs)
- label
 Example: 
    <span>This is an inline element</span>
<a href="#">This is a link</a>
<strong>Bold text</strong>
