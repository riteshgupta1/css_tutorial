Question: Explain the difference between absolute and relative positions.

Solution: 

the position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element.

There are five different position values:

    static
    relative
    fixed
    absolute
    sticky

positon: relative;

An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position.
Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position. 
Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.

Example: 
.box {
  position: relative;
  top: 20px;
  left: 30px;
}


positon absolute

The element is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (an ancestor with relative, absolute, or fixed position).
If no positioned ancestor exists, it positions itself relative to the <html> (document body).
The element is removed from the normal document flow, so it does not affect surrounding elements.

Example: 
.container {
  position: relative; 
}

.box {
  position: absolute;
  top: 20px;
  left: 30px;
}

                                  difference 

      relative                                                      absolute

  Its normal position                                        Nearest positioned ancestor (or <html> if none)

  it still takes up space                                        it removed from normal flow  

  Slight adjustments to layout                                  Floating elements, modals, tooltips
