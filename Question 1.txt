Question: What is the use of float property? Which property is the better alternative to it?

Solution : 

The  float property is used to position elements to the left or right within a container, allowing text or other elements to wrap around it.
The CSS  property specifies how an element should float.
The float property is used for positioning and formatting content e.g. let an image float left to the text in a container.

The float property can have one of the following values:

    left - The element floats to the left of its container
    right - The element floats to the right of its container
    none - The element does not float (will be displayed just where it occurs in the text). This is default
    inherit - The element inherits the float value of its parent


Example :


 <style>
img {
  float: right;
}
</style>

<p>This text will wrap around the floated image.</p>
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Example Image">


This places the image to the right, and text flows around it.

better alternative ---->>

1.Flexbox 
(display: flex;)
Flexbox is best for 1D layouts (row or column alignment) and is more responsive than float.

Exmaple: Centering Two Elements Without Float
.container {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-between;
}
<div class="container">
    <div>Left Content</div>
    <div>Right Content</div>
</div>


2. CSS Grid (
display: grid;)

Example : Creating a 2-column Layout
css code --> 
.container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
}

html code -->
<div class="container">
    <div>Column 1</div>
    <div>Column 2</div>
</div>
