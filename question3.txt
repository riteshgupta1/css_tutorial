Q3.What are the different types of CSS Selectors?
In CSS, selectors are used to target and style specific HTML elements. There are several types of CSS selectors, which can be classified into the following categories:

Basic Selectors
1. Universal Selector (*)*: Selects all elements.
2. Element Selector (element): Selects elements by their HTML tag name (e.g., p, h1, div).
3. Class Selector (.class): Selects elements with a specific class attribute (e.g., .header, .footer).
4. ID Selector (#id): Selects an element with a specific ID attribute (e.g., #header, #footer).

Combinator Selectors
1. Descendant Selector (ancestor descendant): Selects elements that are descendants of a specific ancestor (e.g., div p).
2. Child Selector (parent > child): Selects elements that are direct children of a specific parent (e.g., div > p).
3. Adjacent Sibling Selector (element1 + element2): Selects elements that are adjacent siblings (e.g., h2 + p).
4. General Sibling Selector (element1 ~ element2): Selects elements that are general siblings (e.g., h2 ~ p).

Attribute Selectors
1. Attribute Presence Selector ([attribute]): Selects elements that have a specific attribute (e.g., [href]).
2. Attribute Value Selector ([attribute="value"]): Selects elements that have a specific attribute with a specific value (e.g., [href="https://www.example.com"]).
3. *Attribute Value Contains Selector ([attribute*="value"])*: Selects elements that have a specific attribute with a value containing a specific substring (e.g., [href*="example"]).

Pseudo-Class Selectors
1. Link Pseudo-Class (:link): Selects unvisited links.
2. Visited Pseudo-Class (:visited): Selects visited links.
3. Hover Pseudo-Class (:hover): Selects elements when the user hovers over them.
4. Active Pseudo-Class (:active): Selects elements when they are activated (e.g., clicked).

Pseudo-Element Selectors
1. First-Line Pseudo-Element (::first-line): Selects the first line of a block-level element.
2. First-Letter Pseudo-Element (::first-letter): Selects the first letter of a block-level element.
3. Before Pseudo-Element (::before): Selects the area before the content of an element.
